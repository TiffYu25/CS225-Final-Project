## Instructions

To use and download our code, you must use the command ```git clone https://github.com/TiffYu25/CS225-Final-Project.git``` in your terminal.

Once you have successfully downloaded the project, you may have to delete and rebuild the build folder. After doing so, type in the following into your terminal:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Then you must run ```cmake ..```

You will then be able to compile our code through the main function in main.cpp inside the entry folder. Be sure to type ```make``` then ```./main``` in the terminal if you are compiling something in the main function. You are welcome to test our code by typing ```make``` then ```./test``` in the terminal.

In order to compile our data with the wikipedia dataset, you will have to download our compressed dataset through our google drive and manually insert it into your programming environment.
