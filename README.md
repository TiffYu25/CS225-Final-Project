## Instructions

To use and download our code, you must use the command ```git clone https://github.com/TiffYu25/CS225-Final-Project.git``` in your terminal.

Once you have successfully downloaded the project, you may have to delete and rebuild the build folder. After doing so, type in the following into your terminal:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
You will then be able to compile our code through the main function in main.cpp inside the entry folder. Be sure to type ```make``` then ```./main``` in the terminal if you are compiling something in the main function. You are welcome to test our code by typing ```make``` then ```./test``` in the terminal.

In order to compile our data with the wikipedia dataset, you will have to download our compressed dataset through our [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VIy19fnFQyVdE_TDR3rN1yn11nqfQgFV/view) and manually insert it into your programming environment. MAKE SURE THAT THE FILE IS NOT IN A FOLDER.
