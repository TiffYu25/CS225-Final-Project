# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    Since all group members are easily reachable, we plan to conduct 30 min weekly meetings on Tuesday afternoons. These meetings can be hosted on Discord, as each team member can easily share their screen and utilize the voice call functions. Notes for meetings will probably not be necessary, but they will be recorded in the group chat itself if ongoing questions or issues arise, and they will be pinned in the chat afterward so all members can view them anytime.
    
2. **Assistance** 

    All group members have already exchanged contact information and will communicate with each other using Discord. Each member can be expected to respond within 24 hours after a message is sent in the team group chat. Members are encouraged to consult each other using the Discord group chat if they need help with a task or would like to discuss their opinions on an aspect of the project.
    
3. **Respect** 

    All members are expected to approach the project with an open mind, and we do not expect to have problems with this. However, if issues arise and members are not actively listening or engaging with the thoughts of others, we will address these issues during the weekly meetings or initiate a new meeting entirely to discuss any conflicts. Although members are expected to respect everyone's opinions, they should also express their concerns (either in the group chat itself or to another member privately if they are comfortable) if they feel like their ideas are being ignored or disrespected in any way.
    
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    Before assigning our workload, we will have to break down our project. To do this, the group will figure out a step-by-step plan on how to achieve our desired result. By doing this we will be able to figure out the functions, classes, and other data that we need to create. This way, giving work to each member will be less confusing and quick to assign. To figure out what part of the project to assign to who, we will assign to those who show interest in a section. If there is a section where all members are reluctant to pick up, we will collectively work on it together along with some aid from our mentor. Moreover, we will discuss our strengths and assign them to the task most comfortable for each member. In addition, we will figure out a way to accommodate each other’s weaknesses by assigning partners to work on a single task. 
    
5. **Time Commitment** 

    The amount of hours expected per week will most likely vary, but each member should aim to spend 4–6 hours on the project each week. Generally speaking, as long as each member completes the work they are assigned and is able to timely integrate into the group’s repo, they should be able to manage their time however they wish to. If new conflicts or commitments arise, then the tasks for the project will have to be delegated differently, and this can be done through communication in the group chat, weekly meetings, or a new voice call meeting. The group members are somewhat flexible, and they will help each other if any problems arise (for time commitment issues, group members should express their availability to the other members in the group chat so work can be redistributed afterwards).
    
6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    When there is disagreement between us, we will discuss the pros and cons of both side’s opinions. Once decided we can adjust our ideas to fit both parties, or we can either vote on what to do by majority vote. When one of us has not accomplished their tasks, we will ask if they need any help. Contacting our mentor may be needed if none of us are able to solve the problem. If someone is usually late to meetings, we will be sure to ask the reason why and try to accommodate to their schedule if needed. Although, the meetings can be made not required as we can communicate through Discord of what each of us are contributing to the project. If there is ever a situation where we encounter a problem that none of us can solve, we can ask our mentor for any tips and advice.
