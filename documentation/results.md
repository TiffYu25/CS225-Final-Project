# Output and Correctness (wip)
* Our makefiles are running as expected as typing ```make``` works in our terminal.
* We have thoroughly tested out our graph and algorithms for any unknown bugs. This is including the tests to our helper functions to the main algorithms.
* Our results will be shown in the terminal from ```main.cpp```.
* We have correctly converted our dataset’s txt file into a graph form using adjacency lists. We have tested this using sample txt files and test cases.

### Algorithms & Traversals (wip)
* Our DFS traversal is working as expected. We even have implemented both the iterative and the recursive version.
* Our Strongly Connected Components (wip)
* Our Kruskal’s Algorithm (wip)

# Results we have Found (wip)
* We were unable to finish and polish our Kruskal’s Algorithm as we were in a time crutch. We were able to successfully run our Strongly Connected Component Algorithm along with our DFS traversal method. 
// Insert what was the output if we used the actual dataset
Our project may have been a bit too ambitious considering how busy each of our schedules were. Moreover, we did not anticipate the bugs and runtime errors we would encounter due to the massive size of the 2018 Wikipedia txt file.
